## P6: Make Effective Data Visualization
by Yuheng Cai

### Summary
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.  

This data Visualization shows the demographics and passenger information between those passengers who survived and those who died. The Titanic dataset is downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

### Design
##### Story to Tell - Findings from Exploratory Data Analysis  
* Female passengers had higher chance to survive
* Higher class passengers were more likely to survive

##### Initial Design Decision
index_0.html reflects the initial design decision in order to convey the key findings mentioned above.

* Bar chart type is selected to compare between passengers who survived and died.  
* Multiple bar charts will be needed and grouped based on categorical variables (i.e. PassengerClass, Gender) in order to drill down the comparison.
* Color will be used for differentiating survived and died only; but not for categorical variables since grouping should do the job.
